# Hyper-Local Live Weather Tracking System - IoT Project

## Overview
The Hyper-Local Live Weather Tracking System is an innovative IoT project designed to provide real-time, hyper-local weather information. The project combines an Android app developed in Java with ESP8266 sensors for live data transmission. Users can access up-to-the-minute weather conditions specific to their location, making it an essential tool for daily life.

## Technical Details
- **Android App Development**: Java, Android Studio
- **IoT Component**: ESP8266 sensor
- **Data Transmission**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Weather Data Source**: Live LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor readings

## Features

### Hyper-Local Weather Data
- This project offers hyper-local weather data, providing real-time information about the weather conditions at your exact location.

### IoT Integration
- The project leverages IoT technology through ESP8266 sensors. These sensors continuously send live LDR values to Firebase Realtime Database.

### Real-Time Data Transmission
- The ESP8266 sensor sends live data to Firebase, which is then used to display weather conditions instantly in the Android app.

### Practical Use Cases
- The app is not just for checking the weather; it has practical applications. For example, it can alert you when it starts raining so you can bring in your laundry or tell you if your plants are getting enough sunlight.
